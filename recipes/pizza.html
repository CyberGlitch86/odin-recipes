            Preheat the oven at 250 degree Celsius. To prepare 
            this delicious Cheese Pizza recipe, preheat the oven on 
            convection mode at 250 degree Celsius. Meanwhile, 
            spread the tomato sauce evenly on each pizza base. 
            Take a chopping board and chop onions, tomatoes, 
            capsicum and mushroom on it.
        </li>

            Microwave the veggies for about a minute. Mix all the 
            chopped vegetables and seasoning in a bowl. Microwave 
            these vegetables in a microwave-safe bowl for around 
            30-40 seconds or a minute. Spread this vegetable 
            topping on each pizza base. Sprinkle grated mozzarella 
            cheese at the top of each pizza.
        </li>

            Bake the pizza at for 10-12 minutes. You can either 
            bake this pizza in a microwave or you can use a 
            non-stick tawa for the same. However, in this recipe 
            we have used microwave. Bake the pizza on the high 
            rack at 250 degree Celsius till the cheese melts. It 
            will take around 10-12 minutes. Once baked, add some 
            extra virgin olive oil over the pizza and cut the 
            delicious Cheese Pizza into slices. Serve with sauces.
