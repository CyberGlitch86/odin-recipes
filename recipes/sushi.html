<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    This recipe shows you how to make delicious 
    homemade sushi, containing salmon avocado and cucumber!
</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>2 cups Sushi rice (14 ounces/400 grams)</li>
    <li>7 ounces Smoked Salmon</li>
    <li>1 Large Ripe Avocado</li>
    <li>1 Small Cucumber</li>
    <li>5 Nori Sheets</li>
    <li>1/4 cup Rice Vinegar (60 ml)</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon Sugar</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon Salt</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        Cook the rice following packet instructions. In a small 
        bowl, combine vinegar, sugar and salt and mix until the 
        sugar is dissolved. Pour this over cooked rice and mix 
        well. Let the rice cool down.
    </li>
    <li>
        In the meantime, cut the veggies into thin strips. I 
        like cutting the cucumber and carrots into matchsticks, 
        avocado and salmon into chunks (all of them about 4 
        inch/10 cm long).
    </li>
    <li>
        Now place mat onto your worktop (see note 2), top it 
        with nori sheet so that the rough side is facing you. 
        Spread the rice over the nori sheet, (see note 3) 
        covering it evenly but leaving about 0.5 inch (1.5 cm) 
        of the sheet free. The rice-free end should be farther 
        from you.
    </li>
    <li>
        Place a thin row of salmon, cucumber (or carrot) and 
        avocado in the middle of the rice.
    </li>
    <li>
        Wet the rice-free end with water and roll everything 
        tightly (the mat helps you get a nice round shape and 
        also by applying pressure when rolling, you are making 
        sure the roll stays tight).
    </li>
    <li>
        Slice and serve!
    </li>
</ol>
